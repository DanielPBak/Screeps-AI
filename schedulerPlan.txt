On creep death: remove creep from memory, change energy_en_route

Each job dest creates a job using nearest source with an amount of energy above (say 500).

Priority 1: spawns, extensions
Priority 2: Tower > 50%
Priority 3: Upgrader reserves > 50%
Priority 4: Tower > 90%
Priority 5: Upgrader reserves > 90%
Prioty 6: else

Each seeking creep assigns it self to the nearest job source for which that job has energyEnRoute < energyRequired with the lowest and assigns it that job, adjusting energyEnRoute.


New strat: creep picks up energy, assigned jobs and works jobs until energy_reserved = energy_capacity, picks up energy
And job doesn't care about source

Don't assign deliverer if he will die in transit.
